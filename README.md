.emacs.d
========
I really liked the emacs set up mentioned in http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-26-setting-up-emacs-as-development-environment-on-osx/ . So I decided to set up my emacs configuration ground up :)

1. Install latest stable emacs version available (24.3.x)
2. Install Pallet as mentioned in https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet
3. Clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d
4. Goto ~/.emacs.d and do ```cask install```
5. Start your emacs. 


PS: If emacs complaints about some package being not availabe. Please use "M-x package-install" command to install the same.


TODO
====
1. Install snippts used by Jim Weirich in his emacs set up. eg: https://github.com/jimweirich/emacs-setup/tree/master/snippets/text-mode/ruby-mode
