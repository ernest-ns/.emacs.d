.emacs.d
========
I really liked the emacs set up mentioned in http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-26-setting-up-emacs-as-development-environment-on-osx/ . So I decided to set up my emacs configuration ground up :). Now, I have customized it to suit my tastes.

Also, I have included all the ruby snippets that Jim Weirich had in his emacs setup, 
https://github.com/jimweirich/emacs-setup/tree/master/snippets/text-mode/ruby-mode

1. Install latest stable emacs version available (> 24.3.x)
2. Install Pallet as mentioned in https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet
3. Clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d
4. Goto ~/.emacs.d and do ```cask install```
5. Install Fira Mono Regular ttf font, https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/raw/master/ttf/FiraMono-Regular.ttf
6. Start your emacs.
